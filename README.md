# Project1Group10

## To Run
Our dsl allows users to make 2d single-player games controlled by keyboard.

To run the application, please download the zip file from the GitHub repo. Then unzip it. 

Click into `/Project1Group10-main/Game/src/index.html`, which will open a web page. 

Code can be entered directly in the editor-like area on the right-hand side. Any images you may use should be uploaded before the DSL is run. Once you hit the run button, the input will be compiled, and errors will be shown on the web page. If no error occurs, the game will be displayed on the left-hand side. 

To play the game, the game canvas should be in focus state (by clicking on it).

Languages references can be found in [Wiki page](https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC410-2022W-T1/Project1Group10/wiki/Language-Reference-for-Jetej).

Have fun making games!
