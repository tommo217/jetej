# Milestone One


## Project Description


We plan to design a domain-specific language(DSL) that allows clients to define one agent, multiple objects, and the events triggered when two objects meet when making their own games. Many games can be created this way such as catching apples, big fish eating small fish, and even spacecraft fighting.


## Feedback from TA


Our DSL needs to have programming capability, which means users of our DSL should have the freedom to implement unique features as they want. To achieve this goal, TA suggested that we could improve on the following aspects:

  1. Allow clients to add more arithmetic functions.

  2. Enable clients to track the agent's position.

  3. Programmatically control agent movement.

  4. Allow users to add some procedures like if-else statements or loops


Moreover, we should focus on the design of the DSL instead of game development. We can use some existing APIs for game development to save time. There's no need to make a fancy game.


## Follow-up tasks

1. Think of ways to provide the clients with more dimensions of creativity. 

2. Start to define syntax and documentation.
